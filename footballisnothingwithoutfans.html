          Ancelotti, March 2020</span>
      </blockquote>
      <!-- bold for the hook -->
      <p class="bold">For years we have taken football for granted, from the intense tactical battles to the pre-match pints in crowded pubs. For many football is not zero, it is their everything, and when Covid-19 came to England in early 2020 it
        all got taken away. The beautiful game was on the brink.</p>

      <p>Professional football in England was suspended on March 13th 2020 due to a rising number of coronavirus cases. The Football Association initially announced a three-week postponement to ease the strain on clubs and to monitor the
        national situation, but this postponement went on to last for over three months.</p>
      <p>Carlo Ancelotti, Everton manager at the time, <a href="https://www.evertonfc.com/news/1645705/ancelotti-health-is-the-only-priority">endorsed the shutdown</a>, saying: "We could not continue. Health is the most important thing for everyone:
        teams, fans, media, everyone who works in football."</p>
      <p>The shutdown of football may have been the right decision, but it sparked a turbulent 16-month journey for fans across the country. With lockdown measures now eased and the new Premier League season around the corner, it is time to re-live
        that journey.</p>
      <p>As Jock Stein and Matt Busby proclaimed decades ago: "Football is nothing without fans."</p>

      <h2>The Super League</h2>
      <blockquote id="superleague">
        <!-- blockquote like the one in the intro -->
        <p class="blockquotetext uk-margin-left">I see more a European league developing over time rather than one team going out of the country. The national leagues will survive but maybe in 10 years, you will have a European league."</p>
        <span>Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, August 2009</span>
      </blockquote>
      <!-- an introduction to The Super League -->
      <p>Ars&egrave;ne Wenger predicted a European Super League over 10 years ago and on April 18th 2021 his prediction came true. Despite many expecting it, the announcement of the European Super League shocked the football world and country alike.
      </p>
      <p>The owners of 12 European clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham alongside Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus, announced the formation of The Super
        League, a rival for the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      <p>The announcement sparked a frenzy across England and Europe with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Premier League and UEFA all condemning its formation.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/news/2109307">Premier League statement</a> on April 18th criticised The Super League, stating: "The Premier League condemns any proposal that attacks the principles of open competition and
        sporting merit which are at the heart of the domestic and European football pyramid."</p>
      <p>"Fans of any club in England and across Europe can currently dream that their team may climb to the top and play against the best. We believe that the concept of a European Super League would destroy this dream."</p>
      <p>The meritocracy of the football pyramid became a central argument against The Super League as it was announced that the founding members of the competition would be guaranteed entry, leaving only 5 spaces for teams to qualify based on
        achievements in the prior season.</p>
      <!-- outlining the format of The Super League -->
      <p class="bold uk-margin-large-top">The Format</p>
      <p>The European Super League was to include 20 clubs: AC Milan, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Tottenham, 3 further founding members and 5 teams
        who would qualify based on domestic performance over the previous season.</p>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/YDPd4mB/superleagueteams.png" alt="superleagueteams" border="0">
      <p>The 20 clubs would be split into 2 groups of 10 where each team would play each of the other teams in their group home and away. The top 3 teams from each group would progress into a playoff bracket at the quarter-final stage, whilst the 4th
        and 5th placed teams from each group would compete in a two-legged playoff game to decide the remaining quarter-finalists.</p>
      <p>The quarter-finals and semi-finals would be played as two-legged ties before a single fixture final would be played at a neutral venue in order to determine the winner of The Super League.</p>
      <!-- outlining the justifications of The Super League -->
      <p class="bold uk-margin-large-top">The Justification</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://thesuperleague.com/press.html">press release</a> from The Super League sought to explain why the league was formed, stating: "The formation of the Super League comes at a time when the global pandemic has accelerated the
        instability in the existing European football economic model.</p>
      <p>Further, for a number of years, the Founding Clubs have had the objective of improving the quality and intensity of existing European competitions throughout each season, and of
        creating a format for top clubs and players to compete on a regular basis."</p>
      <p>The 12 founding clubs had accumulated in excess of &#163;4.3 billion of debt by the time The Super League was announced. A lack of matchday income due to no fans contributed significantly to the losses of these clubs whilst
        operating costs and wages remained high despite cuts being made.</p>
      <p>In his prediction of a super league, Arsene Wenger referenced money as a driving force, saying: "The way we are going financially is that even the money that will be coming in from the Champions League will not be enough for some clubs
        because they spend too much money."</p>
      <p>JP Morgan, a leading investment banking company, pledged &#163;2.8 billion to the founding clubs to help launch The Super League, allowing for the rebuilding of infrastructure and recovery from the pandemic.</p>
      <!-- outlining the reaction to The Super League -->
      <p class="bold uk-margin-large-top">The Reaction</p>
      <p>The reaction to The Super League from fans and media alike was overwhelmingly negative. News broke during Sky Sports' Super Sunday and BT Sport's FA Cup Semi-Final coverage, sparking a <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC08HPDlJlA">raw and emotional response</a> from the pundits on live television.</p>

        <p>"It is criminal. It is a criminal act against football fans in this country make no mistake about it. This is the biggest sport in the world, this is the biggest sport in this country and it is a criminal act against the fans, simple as

  <!-- Michael Cox's view to provide balance -->
  <!-- since the reaction to the ESL was so overtly negative, it was tough to find many authorities who were advocating, or at least respecting it -->
  <!-- side note - despite a lot of advanced searching on twitter, I struggled to find a tweet with more than 500 likes which supported the ESL in any way -->
  <div class="uk-width-medium-6-10 uk-container-center">
    <p>One of the few not to instantly dismiss The Super League was Michael Cox of The Athletic, pointing out the flaws in the current system: "Use any measure you like - points totals, goal difference, titles, wage bills - and inspect the trajectory
      of major European leagues over the past two decades, and it becomes clear we are experiencing staggering, rampant inequality completely off the scale."</p>
    <p>Bayern Munich have won 9 Bundesligas in a row, Juventus have won 9 of the last 10 Serie A titles, Paris Saint Germain have won Ligue Un 7 of the last 9 years, Barcelona have won 5 La Liga's in 10 years and Manchester City have 5 Premier League
      titles in the past decade.</p>
    <p>While Cox's argument is well-founded, the sheer backlash from supporters in England became so intense that any logical justification of The Super League received little thought.</p>
    <p>This same backlash helped to sway FIFA's stance on The Super League, which they had once backed following an approach from Spanish finance consortium A22 in 2019. The Super League required the support of FIFA to launch in April, and their
      U-turn helped seal the league's fate.</p>

      <h2>Ownership Protests</h2>
      <p id="ownershipprotests">The uproar from football fans towards The Super League spilled over into deeper grievances for both Arsenal and Manchester United supporters. As a result, mass protests ensued at both clubs as supporters sought to
        voice their displeasure towards their owners.</p>
      <!-- Arsenal section of the ownership protests -->
      <p class="bold uk-margin-large-top">Arsenal</p>
      <p>Thousands gathered outside Emirates Stadium ahead of Arsenal vs Everton on April 23rd to speak out against Arsenal's owner Stan Kroenke.</p>
      <p>Ian Wright, former Arsenal striker, gave his support for the protestors outside the Emirates, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvr5bjGOUsc">telling DAZN</a>: "I stand with them."</p>
      <p>"We are talking about a silent owner. Since he has been at our club he has not invested in our club properly. The way they buy the club, the way they serviced the debt with this club, the fact they wanted to go into this competition [The
        Super League], it is like they have given up on us."</p>
      <p>A large group of supporters began the protest walking around the stadium holding up signs and lighting flares, with loud chants including "we want our Arsenal back" and "get out of our club."</p>
      <p class="uk-margin-large-bottom">The supporters eventually gathered outside the main entrance to the stadium in full voice.</p>

      Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Viera.</p>
    <p>The offer was rejected as the Kroenke's 'don't need the money' but Ek insisted his offer would remain on the table should they ever want to sell.</p>

    <p>Manchester United's game against Liverpool became the heart of a mass protest at Old Trafford on May 2nd with United fans calling for owners, the Glazers, to sell the club following their agreement to join The Super League.</p>
    <p>Thousands of fans descended on Old Trafford chanting against the Glazers alongside banners and flares before a small number eventually breaking onto the pitch.</p>

  <div class="uk-width-medium-6-10 uk-container-center uk-margin-large-top">
    <p>Adam Blaize, a Manchester United fan at the protest, discussed his main issue with the owners, stating: "Manchester United were a debt-free club since 1931 and the Glazers bought them with loan payments and the debt has been rising."</p>
    <p>"They will say there has been investment in the club in different areas but it has been poor investment" he added.</p>
    <p>The impact of the protest was overshadowed somewhat by a small number of individuals carrying out acts of violence against police and staff.</p>
    <p>One police officer suffered a slash to the face, almost damaging his eye. A man was arrested on suspicion of assault but has since been released on bail with Greater Manchester Police urging witnesses to come forward.</p>
    <p>The game itself was eventually rearranged for the safety of the players and staff, being played on May 13th.</p>

      <p class="uk-margin-large-top">Jonathan Rhodes, Sport Psychologist, explained the discrepancy between home form and away form in a typical season with fans, saying: "There is usually a home advantage because of an increase in motivation and
        thus effort due to increased
        arousal and mutual support."</p>
      <p>Rhodes' suggestion as to why the difference between home and away performance has been altered over the past two seasons is that "players need anxiety and this has been limited in home matches and enhanced in away performance."</p>
      <p>Emily Collett, a fellow Sport Psychologist, suggested that a factor in this change is "the crowd having a possible influence on refereeing" impacting both the home and away team.</p>
      <p class="uk-margin-large-bottom">She also highlighted the players' will to play in front of fans: "A lot of players this season have mentioned missing fans and cannot wait to perform in front of fans, and the change of atmosphere, as well as
        the other factors mentioned likely had a huge impact on performance as we have seen this season."</p>

      <h2>Summer and Beyond</h2>
      <p id="whatsnext" class="uk-margin-top">Since the end of the Premier League season, the European Championships have taken England by storm.</p>
      <p>Wembley Stadium hosted eight games in total including all but one of England's games en route to the final. Both Semi-Finals and the Final, between England and Italy, were played at Wembley with the final reaching a capacity of 67,173.</p>

    <!-- I felt it important to acknowledge the negatives of the Euro final in particular -->
    <!-- whilst the piece gives a voice mostly of the general and passionate football fan, football fans are not perfect as a collective -->
    <p>Despite the increased fan attendance at Wembley representing a transition towards normality for England, the European Championship Final shone a negative light on the return of fans to sporting venues.</p>
    <p>Thousands of fans forced their way into the stadium without a ticket, resulting in several stewards getting injured, whilst family members and guests of the two teams were abused and forced to leave their seats. In the process, Covid-19
      checkpoints were breached as well as Italy fans' bio-secure bubble which allowed them to travel to the game.</p>
    <p>Following the Euro Final, the Community Shield curtain raiser between Manchester City and Leicester City will be the next major football match to be played at Wembley, kicking off the 2021/22 season.</p>
    <p>David Elleray was pleased for Wembley to host fans once again, <a href="https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/jul/22/20210722-paul-tierney-to-referee-fa-community-shield-2021">stating</a>: "We are delighted at the prospect of the 2021 FA Community
      Shield being played in a partially-full Wembley Stadium and, with this return to 'normality' match."</p>
    <p class="uk-margin-large-bottom">It has been a long journey for football fans, but the beautiful game is nearly back.</p>
